# Active Directory Attack Lab

This project documents the process of building a full Active Directory home lab and simulating common real-world attacks used by attackers in enterprise environments.

The goal of this lab was to understand how Active Directory attacks actually work from an attacker perspective and how defenders can detect them.

This lab was built using VirtualBox with one Domain Controller, two Windows clients, and a Kali Linux attacker machine.
